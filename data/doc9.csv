9,1,"Headline Statements from the Summary for Policymakers 9 August 2021 subject to final copyediting A The Current State of the Climate A1 It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere ocean and land Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere ocean cryosphere and biosphere have occurred A2 The scale of recent changes across the climate system as a whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate system are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years A3 Humaninduced climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves heavy precipitation droughts and tropical cyclones and in particular their attribution to human influence has strengthened since the Fifth Assessment Report AR5 A4 Improved knowledge of climate processes paleoclimate evidence and the response of the climate system to increasing radiative forcing gives a best estimate of equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3°C with a narrower range compared to AR5 B Possible Climate Futures B1 Global surface temperature will continue to increase until at least the midcentury under all emissions scenarios considered Global warming of 15°C and 2°C will be exceeded during the 21st century unless deep reductions in carbon dioxide CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions occur in the coming decades B2 Many changes in the climate system become larger in direct relation to increasing global warming They include increases in the frequency and intensity of hot extremes marine heatwaves and heavy precipitation agricultural and ecological droughts in some regions and proportion of intense tropical cyclones as well as reductions in Arctic sea ice snow cover and permafrost B3 Continued global warming is projected to further intensify the global water cycle including its variability global monsoon precipitation and the severity of wet and dry events B4 Under scenarios with increasing CO2 emissions the ocean and land carbon sinks are projected to be less effective at slowing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere B5 Many changes due to past and future greenhouse gas emissions are irreversible for centuries to millennia especially changes in the ocean ice sheets and global sea level"
9,2,"C Climate Information for Risk Assessment and Regional Adaptation C1 Natural drivers and internal variability will modulate humancaused changes especially at regional scales and in the near term with little effect on centennial global warming These modulations are important to consider in planning for the full range of possible changes C2 With further global warming every region is projected to increasingly experience concurrent and multiple changes in climatic impactdrivers Changes in several climatic impactdrivers would be more widespread at 2°C compared to 15°C global warming and even more widespread andor pronounced for higher warming levels C3 Lowlikelihood outcomes such as ice sheet collapse abrupt ocean circulation changes some compound extreme events and warming substantially larger than the assessed very likely range of future warming cannot be ruled out and are part of risk assessment D Limiting Future Climate Change D1 From a physical science perspective limiting humaninduced global warming to a specific level requires limiting cumulative CO2 emissions reaching at least net zero CO2 emissions along with strong reductions in other greenhouse gas emissions Strong rapid and sustained reductions in CH4 emissions would also limit the warming effect resulting from declining aerosol pollution and would improve air quality D2 Scenarios with low or very low greenhouse gas GHG emissions SSP119 and SSP1 26 lead within years to discernible effects on greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations and air quality relative to high and very high GHG emissions scenarios SSP370 or SSP585 Under these contrasting scenarios discernible differences in trends of global surface temperature would begin to emerge from natural variability within around 20 years and over longer time periods for many other climatic impactdrivers high confidence"
