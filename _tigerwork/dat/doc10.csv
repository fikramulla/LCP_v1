10,8,"Summary for Policymakers Introduction This Summary for Policymakers SPM presents key findings of the Working Group I WGI contribution to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC Sixth Assessment Report AR61 on the physical science basis of climate change The report builds upon the 2013 Working Group I contribution to the IPCCs Fifth Assessment Report AR5 and the 20182019 IPCC Special Reports2 of the AR6 cycle and incorporates subsequent new evidence from climate science3 SPM This SPM provides a highlevel summary of the understanding of the current state of the climate including how it is changing and the role of human influence the state of knowledge about possible climate futures climate information relevant to regions and sectors and limiting humaninduced climate change Based on scientific understanding key findings can be formulated as statements of fact or associated with an assessed level of confidence indicated using the IPCC calibrated language4 The scientific basis for each key finding is found in chapter sections of the main Report and in the integrated synthesis presented in the Technical Summary hereafter TS and is indicated in curly brackets The AR6 WGI Interactive Atlas facilitates exploration of these key synthesis findings and supporting climate change information across the WGI reference regions5 A The Current State of the Climate Since AR5 improvements in observationally based estimates and information from paleoclimate archives provide a comprehensive view of each component of the climate system and its changes to date New climate model simulations new analyses and methods combining multiple lines of evidence lead to improved understanding of human influence on a wider range of climate variables including weather and climate extremes The time periods considered throughout this section depend upon the availability of observational products paleoclimate archives and peerreviewed studies A1 It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere ocean and land Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere ocean cryosphere and biosphere have occurred 22 23 CrossChapter Box 23 33 34 35 36 38 52 53 64 73 83 92 93 95 96 CrossChapter Box 91 Figure SPM1 Figure SPM2 A11 Observed increases in wellmixed greenhouse gas GHG concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally caused by human activities Since 2011 measurements reported in AR5 concentrations have continued to increase in the atmosphere reaching annual averages of 410 parts per million ppm for carbon dioxide CO2 1866 parts per billion ppb for methane CH4 and 332 ppb for nitrous oxide N2O in 20196 Land and ocean have taken up a nearconstant proportion globally about 56 per year of CO2 emissions from human activities over the past six decades with regional differences high confidence7 22 52 73 TS22 Box TS5 1 Decision IPCCXLVI2 2 The three Special Reports are Global Warming of 15°C An IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 15°C above preindustrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty SR15 Climate Change and Land An IPCC Special Report on climate change desertification land degradation sustainable land management food security and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems SRCCL IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate SROCC 3 The assessment covers scientific literature accepted for publication by 31 January 2021 4 Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers very low low medium high and very high and typeset in italics for example medium confidence The following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or result virtually certain 99100 probability very likely 90100 likely 66100 about as likely as not 3366 unlikely 033 very unlikely 010 and exceptionally unlikely 01 Additional terms extremely likely 95100 more likely than not >50100 and extremely unlikely 05 are also used when appropriate Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics for example very likely This is consistent with AR5 In this Report unless stated otherwise square brackets x to y are used to provide the assessed very likely range or 90 interval 5 The Interactive Atlas is available at httpsinteractiveatlasipccch 6 Other GHG concentrations in 2019 were perfluorocarbons PFCs 109 parts per trillion ppt CF4 equivalent sulphur hexafluoride SF6 10 ppt nitrogen trifluoride NF3 2 ppt hydrofluorocarbons HFCs 237 ppt HFC134a equivalent other Montreal Protocol gases mainly chlorofluorocarbons CFCs and hydrochlorofluorocarbons HCFCs 1032 ppt CFC12 equivalent Increases from 2011 are 19 ppm for CO2 63 ppb for CH4 and 8 ppb for N2O 7 Land and ocean are not substantial sinks for other GHGs 4"
10,9,"Summary for Policymakers A12 Each of the last four decades has been successively warmer than any decade that preceded it since 1850 Global surface temperature8 in the first two decades of the 21st century 20012020 was 099 084 to 110 °C higher than 185019009 Global surface temperature was 109 095 to 120 °C higher in 20112020 than 18501900 with larger increases over land 159 134 to 183 °C than over the ocean 088 068 to 101 °C The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 20032012 +019 016 to 022 °C Additionally methodological advances and new datasets contributed approximately 01°C to the updated estimate of warming in AR610 SPM 23 CrossChapter Box 23 Figure SPM1 A13 The likely range of total humancaused global surface temperature increase from 18501900 to 2010201911 is 08°C to 13°C with a best estimate of 107°C It is likely that wellmixed GHGs contributed a warming of 10°C to 20°C other human drivers principally aerosols contributed a cooling of 00°C to 08°C natural drivers changed global surface temperature by 01°C to +01°C and internal variability changed it by 02°C to +02°C It is very likely that wellmixed GHGs were the main driver12 of tropospheric warming since 1979 and extremely likely that humancaused stratospheric ozone depletion was the main driver of cooling of the lower stratosphere between 1979 and the mid1990s 33 64 73 TS23 CrossSection Box TS1 Figure SPM2 A14 Globally averaged precipitation over land has likely increased since 1950 with a faster rate of increase since the 1980s medium confidence It is likely that human influence contributed to the pattern of observed precipitation changes since the mid20th century and extremely likely that human influence contributed to the pattern of observed changes in nearsurface ocean salinity Midlatitude storm tracks have likely shifted poleward in both hemispheres since the 1980s with marked seasonality in trends medium confidence For the Southern Hemisphere human influence very likely contributed to the poleward shift of the closely related extratropical jet in austral summer 23 33 83 92 TS23 TS24 Box TS6 A15 Human influence is very likely the main driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease in Arctic sea ice area between 19791988 and 20102019 decreases of about 40 in September and about 10 in March There has been no significant trend in Antarctic sea ice area from 1979 to 2020 due to regionally opposing trends and large internal variability Human influence very likely contributed to the decrease in Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover since 1950 It is very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed surface melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet over the past two decades but there is only limited evidence with medium agreement of human influence on the Antarctic Ice Sheet mass loss 23 34 83 93 95 TS25 A16 It is virtually certain that the global upper ocean 0700 m has warmed since the 1970s and extremely likely that human influence is the main driver It is virtually certain that humancaused CO2 emissions are the main driver of current global acidification of the surface open ocean There is high confidence that oxygen levels have dropped in many upper ocean regions since the mid20th century and medium confidence that human influence contributed to this drop 23 35 36 53 92 TS24 A17 Global mean sea level increased by 020 015 to 025 m between 1901 and 2018 The average rate of sea level rise was 13 06 to 21 mm yr1 between 1901 and 1971 increasing to 19 08 to 29 mm yr1 between 1971 and 2006 and further increasing to 37 32 to 42 mm yr1 between 2006 and 2018 high confidence Human influence was very likely the main driver of these increases since at least 1971 23 35 96 CrossChapter Box 91 Box TS4 8 The term global surface temperature is used in reference to both global mean surface temperature and global surface air temperature throughout this SPM Changes in these quantities are assessed with high confidence to differ by at most 10 from one another but conflicting lines of evidence lead to low confidence in the sign direction of any difference in longterm trend CrossSection Box TS1 9 The period 18501900 represents the earliest period of sufficiently globally complete observations to estimate global surface temperature and consistent with AR5 and SR15 is used as an approximation for preindustrial conditions 10 Since AR5 methodological advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature including in the Arctic These and other improvements have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 01°C but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since AR5 11 The period distinction with A12 arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period The observed warming to 20102019 is 106 088 to 121 °C 12 Throughout this SPM main driver means responsible for more than 50 of the change 5"
