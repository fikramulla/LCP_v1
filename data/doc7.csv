Given its efficacy remote training is probably here to stay even if combined with inperson initiatives A question remains as to what other strategies can make statistical capacitybuilding more effective and sustainable A study of national statistical training programmes in 15 countries led by the Global Network of Institutes for Statistical Training GIST showed that many countries have been proactive in identifying training needs and offering training opportunities for their staff Among the lessons learned one stands out a key element in effective capacitybuilding is to set priorities by internal needs rather than those driven by external partners Areas that are in high demand but often overlooked by traditional statistical trainings include the The Sustainable Development Goals
